> Random note that might be interesting to people: here are 3 catalogs of data visualization types â€“ not software per se, but rather, visualization approaches & display types. I find these useful when trying to figure out how to display any given data set. The rest of you have probably seen some or all of these already. (If you've come across other ones like this, please do tell!)
