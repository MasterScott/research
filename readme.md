# Data Together Research <img width="80px" align="right" src=".graphics/data-together-icon.png">

This repository contains a compilation of research for tackling the general problem of data resilience & interactivity in all its forms. This is raw research, and doesn't necessarily need to culminate in a "point". Half the challenge of doing good work is knowing what already exists!
