# Research

A compilation of research for tackling the general problem of data resilliance & interactivity in all it's forms. This is raw research, and doesn't necessarily need to culminate in a "point". Half the challenge of doing good work is knowing what already exists.

### Contributing
Don't be shy. If you have a resource, piece of knowledge, anything that you'd like to share, Pull requests are welcome and will be merged aggressively.

We try to map a topics to directories, feel free to add categories. If you'd like to add something that fits more than one category, feel free to chuck it in both.

### Roadmap:
1. Compile knowledge in raw markdown files
2. Restructure this into a github pages project
