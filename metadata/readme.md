Inferring metadata and other information
========================================

This directory contains summaries of particularly notable systems on the topic of inferring metadata and other information from files and other resources.

Metadata extraction via direct content analysis
-----------------------------------------------

These are systems aimed at extracting metadata primarily by being designed to recognize specific file formats.  Whatever inference they may do is limited to hard-coded, built-in knowledge about data types.

* **[FITS](FITS.md)**: File Information Tool Set (FITS) 


Metadata inference
------------------

These are systems that go beyond simple metadata extraction, and infer content information using machine learning, artificial intelligence, or human intelligence (e.g., via crowd sourcing or other means).

* **[DeepDive](DeepDive.md)**: data management system that supports extraction, integration, and prediction
