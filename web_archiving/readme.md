Comparison of web archiving software
====================================

There exist many software systems for crawling and archiving web sites.  It is not always easy to tell which features different software systems possess or how different software systems differ from each other.  The goal of this research project is to fill this gap, by providing a comprehensive comparison of software systems for archiving web sites.

The current form of this comparison is a [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FqxwaZnIhhQ7jDCC-W64NMRf5rDeh2Shx3u01MsBmTQ/edit#gid=0):

The meanings of the columns are the following:

* _**Name**_: the most common name for the software.

* _**Open source?**_: the open source license for the software, if it is open source; if it is not open source, then this column will have a cross in it; and if it is some kind of mix (such as a for-pay service that uses an open-source tool at its core), then it will have the symbol &frac12;.

* _**Source repo**_:

* _**Operating system(s)**_:

* _**Primary dev. language**_:

* _**CLI**_:

* _**GUI**_:

* _**WUI**_:

* _**Extensibility framework**_:

* _**Parallel crawling**_:

* _**Crawl storage format(s)**_:

* _**Capture raw response?**_:

* _**Handle JavaScript?**_:

* _**Handle web forms?**_:

* _**Handle Flash?**_:

* _**Handle databases?**_:

* _**Browse?**_:

* _**Playback?**_:

* _**Full-text search**_:
