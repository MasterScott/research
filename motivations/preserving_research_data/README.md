This is an annotated bibliography of research relevant to motivating the need for preserving research data.  This began as background research work as part of developing funding proposals to pursue projects in data preservation.  It is admittedly biased towards academic research laboratories, but hopefully with other people's contributions over time, it can be broadened.

*Usage notes*: Under the main topic headings, there are lists of references.  Each reference has a small triangle (▶︎) to the left of it .  Clicking your pointer on the triangle will expand the reference to show more information and annotations about that reference.  The reference itself (colored in blue) is a hyperlink to the actual paper.

<em>
Outstanding article. Lays out the problem faced by libraries to preserve research output when much of scholarly data is never disseminated or published in a conventional form. Coined the term "dark data": "any data that is not easily found by potential users. Dark data may be positive or negative research findings or from either “large” or “small” science. Like dark matter, this dark data on the basis of volume may be more important than that which can be easily seen." Applies the concept of long-tail economics to science data. Discusses in a single place essentially all of the problems faced today by data preservation efforts in academia.

## Data sharing and archiving by researchers

<em>Research providing evidence for the poor state of data archiving and availability of data. This is not about data disappearance or link rot, but rather about whether researchers bother to share their data in the first place.</em>

They studied how many of the data sets generated annually by NIH-funded researchers was not deposited in a known data repository. They did this by analyzing journal articles in PubMed Central that could be identified as NIH-funded. They found "about 12% of the articles explicitly mention deposition of datasets in recognized repositories, leaving 88% that are invisible datasets." (Note that this does not necessarily mean the datasets are completely inaccessible, only that the are not reported as being deposited in a known location. They may be available from somewhere.) They also discuss how discoverability could be improved.

<em>
Examined publication of NIH-funded clinical trials by searching Medline and correlating with ClinicalTrials.gov. Found "fewer than half of trials funded by NIH are published in a peer reviewed biomedical journal indexed by Medline within 30 months of trial completion. Moreover, after a median of 51 months after trial completion, a third of trials remained unpublished."</em>

<em>
Surveyed researchers and asked them why they did or did not share their data. Also investigates some of the difficulties reported b people who do try to share their data. This is the best survey of its kind that I have found so far. This provides evidence that scientists have lots of excuses not to deposit their data in data archives.

Short commentary on the state of data archiving and what the authors think it will take to improve things. Echoes much of what we already know. The following are some choice quotes: "We argue that most scientists view data deposition in remote archives as a burden, because it is too far removed from their daily routine." […] "The human interaction in the data pathway creates unacceptable bottlenecks: only an automated process can turn around the full quantity of data that are generated and published. The curation system simply will be overwhelmed if all data are to be submitted." […] "… we propose that each scientific institution should support its scientists in the form of local data navigators, in combination with structured data storage."

<em>
Examined the hypothesis that researchers are reluctant to share data because the fear that reanalysis by other people may expose errors in their work or produce contradictory conclusions. Of 49 authors contacted, 21 shared some data; 13 failed to respond; 3 refused to share; 12 promised to share at a later date but never even after 6 years. Wicherts et al. then examined the correlation between the statistical power of the authors' published papers and their willingness to share data. They found authors were less likely to want to share data when the results they published had lower statistical power.

## Data disappearance and link rot

<em>Studies of link rot (or "URL corrosion") and general disappearance of data and electronic resources that were ostensibly available at one time.</em>

<em>
Surveyed researchers in ecology and evolution research, about public data archiving in repositories such as Dryad. Found considerable resistance. The reasons given by researchers concern what data would be archived and to whom access would be given. The paper gives a list of reasons for objections given by people, and proposes some possible solutions. One of the suggestions is this: "Data could be archived on institutional servers, and the institution and its staff could control access and determine if collaboration is appropriate. [...]. Such institutional databases also allow the preservation of data and their accessibility after the Pl retires."  Another idea: "implement data-tracking, allowing data collectors to obtain information  on who is using the data and why. For example, any request for data to the Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security Data Portal triggers an email to be sent to the PI who deposited the data. Journals should have a rule that no paper is considered where the data users have not corresponded with the data owners and included appropriate acknowledgement of the source of the data within the paper."</em>

<em>
Examined the impact of journal policies on the availability of data. Found that when journals required archiving of data, it improves the odds of finding the data online by 1000 times. However, when it is not a requirement, less than 23% of the data was available online. Journals studied focused on evolutionary biology and included BMC Evolutionary Biology and PLoS One. Conclusion: mandatory data deposition rules by journals had the greatest impact on data availability.
