### Terms & Topics
* [participatory action research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_action_research)
* "C" science as an umbrella term, because the term "citizen" is problemmatic, also see civic science, community science, and the most general "public participation in science". Also notable "street science" (Coburn)

### Criticism
* [Why SciStarter Is Bad for Citizen Science](https://blog.zooniverse.org/2013/03/12/why-scistarter-com-is-bad-for-citizen-science/) - Note that Chris Lintott, one of the founders of Zooniverse and the author of this post, has since changed his opinion after SciStarter addressed some of these concerns.
